My place to put any code I think I or someone else might need later

# Note
This whole repository is going under some restructuring right now. The original repository was a small side project I was working on to recreate the parts of browsers' default Window interface that I used most that weren't found in Nodejs; i.e. XMLHttpRequest (Rest in Peace), fetch, atob & btoa, etc. The original repository was a complete mess, as it quickly grew to be a place for me to put any useful functions or boilerplate code I made to be reused later. Given the very unstructured condition of the previous repository, its all being refactored and moved over here.
